=> Computer vision lexicon:

- Area of ​​interest: the part of the image that must be processed
- Hystogram: it is the distribution (frequency) of grayscale (GS) of an image

- Segmentation: operation which consists of extracting geometric primitives from an image.
    => The most used primitives:
        => Segments (outlines)
        => Surfaces( regions)
- Calibration: operation which consists in finding the relation between the coordinates in the image and the coordinates in the space of the scene.
- Filter: takes an input image and produces a (cleaner) output image
- LUT(Lool Up Table): conversion table that groups neighboring NG pixels into a single value.
    => Matrix with different pixel values
    => By doing operations on the LUTs it allows to process the image
- PIXEL (Picture ELement): it is the smallest element of a digital image (2D)
- VIXEL (Volumic PIXEL): pixel of a 3D image
- Recale: geometric transformation technique allowing to go from a source image to a target image (destination)

- Morphological:
    => Skeleton
    => Erosion
    => Dilation
- Frequency
    => Frame
    => Equalize
    => Opening(object)
    => Closure(hole)
    => Filter(freq)

- Operators:
    => img(src) -> Img(destination)
    => img (src) -> information set
    => information set -> img(destination)
    
# Finding Lanes Lines  : 
1/ load image => OK 
    => pip install opencv-python

2/ Gray Scale (Niveau de Gris (NG))
- Edge Detection : identifying sharp changes in intensity in adjacent pixels

+--+-----+---+-----+--+

+ : represents the edge 

- img => 2D matrix => Array of pixels 
- pixel  : light intensity of some location in the img 

[0 0 255 255]

where : 
    0 : Black 
    255 : White 

- Gradient : measure of change in brightness over adjacent pixels 
=> strong gradient (0 - 255)
=> small gradient (0 - 15 ...)

- Edge : rapid change in brightness

### detection process ###

goal : (original img) => gradient img 

1/ original img (RGN : 3 channels ) => grayscale img (1 channel)
2/ Use Hough Transform : a polar parametric space (parameters of the line)
    => pixels can mathematically be represented in a scatter graph 
    => we can the draw a (straight) line => (y =  mx + b )
    => convert cartesian plan (m, b) to polar plan (Theta, Rho)
    => the (new)pixel is the intersection of the lines in Hough space
    => Also the (new) pixel represents the line chosen by the system of votes (numbers of intersections ) of severals courves of the plan 
    => vote : number of intersection  

3/ Optimization :
